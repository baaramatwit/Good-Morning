Morning Motivation Reminder
This Python script is designed to provide you with a daily dose of motivation and encouragement. It sends you a text message every morning at 6:30 AM, reminding you to work hard, give your best effort, and stay positive throughout the day. This can help you kickstart your day with a positive mindset, whether you're heading to work, the gym, engaging in community activities, or spending time with your family.
How It Works
The script uses the requests library to make an HTTP POST request to textbelt.com, a service that allows you to send text messages. It includes the following information in the request:
•	Phone Number: The recipient's phone number (in this case, '8572597369'). You can customize this to your own phone number.
•	Message: A motivational message to start your day with positivity. You can modify this message to suit your preferences.
•	API Key: The authentication key required by textbelt.com to send the message.
Usage

1.	Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2.	Install the requests library if you haven't already by running:
pip install requests 
3.	Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., morning_motivation.py).
4.	Customize the script:
•	Modify the phone number in the send_message function to your own.
•	Update the motivational message to something that inspires you the most.
•	Ensure that you have the correct API key from textbelt.com if needed.
5.	Run the script:
python morning_motivation.py 
6.	Keep the script running, and it will send you a motivational message every day at 6:30 AM.
